# Run Demo Maker

Generate a complete narrated product demo from the current codebase.

## Prerequisites

- `.demo-maker/` directory must exist (run `/demo-maker:activate` first)
- `.demo-maker/config.json` must have at least one API key (or demo will use caption-only mode)

## Step 0: Locate Demo Maker

Find the demo-maker root directory. Try in order:
1. `.demo-maker-plugin/` in the project root
2. The directory containing this skill file's grandparent (Claude plugin install — navigate from `skills/run-demo-maker/SKILL.md` up to the plugin root)

Store this path as `DM_ROOT` — all scripts and prompts are relative to it.

Verify:
```bash
ls "$DM_ROOT/prompts/00-MAIN.md"
```

## Step 1: Preflight

Run preflight checks:
```bash
node "$DM_ROOT/scripts/preflight.js"
```

If preflight fails, stop and report. Do not proceed.

## Step 2: Analyze Project

Read and execute: `$DM_ROOT/prompts/01-ANALYZE.md`

Store analysis results — every subsequent step uses this data.

## Step 3: Creative Strategy

Read and execute: `$DM_ROOT/prompts/02-STRATEGY.md`

Ask the user 4-5 multiple-choice questions about platform, tone, focus, style, and case study integration. Store answers.

## Step 4: Generate Script

Read and execute: `$DM_ROOT/prompts/03-SCRIPT.md`

Generate narration script, run anti-slop validation, present to user for approval.

## Step 5: Plan Storyboard

Read and execute: `$DM_ROOT/prompts/04-STORYBOARD.md`

Create scene-by-scene plan with visuals, timing, and transitions. Save to `.demo-maker/storyboard.json`.

## Step 6: Capture Screens

Read and execute: `$DM_ROOT/prompts/05-CAPTURE.md`

Record the product in action via Playwright (web apps) or terminal recorder (CLI tools). Output to `.demo-maker/captures/`.

## Step 7: Generate Narration

Read and execute: `$DM_ROOT/prompts/06-NARRATE.md`

Generate voice audio via ElevenLabs (or fallback). Output to `.demo-maker/narration/`.

## Step 8: Render Video

Read and execute: `$DM_ROOT/prompts/07-RENDER.md`

Assemble captures + narration into final MP4 with captions and watermark. Output to `OUTPUT/{run-id}/demo-full.mp4`.

## Step 9: Generate Cut-Downs

Read and execute: `$DM_ROOT/prompts/08-CUTDOWNS.md`

Create platform-specific versions (Twitter 30s, Product Hunt 45s, GitHub 60s + GIF). Output to `OUTPUT/{run-id}/`.

## Step 10: Integrate

Read and execute: `$DM_ROOT/prompts/09-INTEGRATE.md`

Push demo into Case Study Maker and Git Launcher ecosystems. Offer to apply assets.

## Rules

- Create `OUTPUT/{run-id}/` folder at project root for ALL outputs (where run-id is `demo-{YYYYMMDD}-{HHmmss}`)
- NEVER overwrite files outside `OUTPUT/` without asking
- If a script/step fails, skip it and continue (note what was skipped)
- Execute steps IN ORDER
- Always present script for user approval before proceeding to capture
- The "Made with Demo Maker" watermark is always included
